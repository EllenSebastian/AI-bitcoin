"""
This class collects prices from the Coinbase API and outputs them to files. 
Each file is a csv where the first column is the timestamp, second column is the buy price, and the third column is the sell price.
An effort is made to have each time stamp be divisible by the interval (e.g. 1418716920 for interval=60), but this is not guaranteed to be the case.
